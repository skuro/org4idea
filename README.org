#+TITLE: org4idea: edit org-mode files from IntelliJ

[[media/screenshot_new.png]]

* Introduction

This plugin provides basic editing support for [[http://orgmode.org/][org-mode]] files in IntelliJ.

 At the moment, only  support for syntax highlight of comments and outlines is provided.

*org4idea* is still in its /inception / pre-alpha / here-be-dragons phase/. Use at your own risk.

* Pending basic features
** Basic Editing
These feature only requires some Intellij customisation of the plugin, and basic lexing rules

  - [X] spellcheckying
  - [X] active live template
  - [X] keyword/blocs highlight
  - [X] Commenter
  - [X] Highligting of blocs, and keywords
  - [ ] bold, slant, code highlight

** Structure aware features
  The following feature will require some working grammar and a parser to be really supported.
  - [ ] proper file parsing
  - [ ] folding
  - [ ] tagging

** Miscellaneous
- create new org file
- capture like actions
- Link support
- Export and html preview (relying on a background emacs)
- the one you might suggest or implement
- Line marker

* Building from source
- setup :: Open the module setting and select /Intellij IDEA Plugin SDK/ as project SDK
- run/test :: Use /Run Configuration/ to run the plugin and tests
  # when there will be some
- release :: /Build > Prepare plugin for deployment/ to generate the release package.
# inspiration from idea-markdown
Ensure that *Plugin DevKit* is activated (=Settings | Plugins=). You might also need the =JFlex= support if you are considering tweaking the lexing rules
